  <h1>What I Think I Know About Covid</h1>

    
    <p>This is an ongoing project by <a href="https://twitter.com/RHPeel">@RHPeel</a> to track covid-19. Someone else should do something like this but I haven't seen anything like it, so I decided to do it myself.</p>

  // Declare variables
  var input, filter, table, tr, td, i, txtValue;
  input = document.getElementById("myInput");
  filter = input.value.toUpperCase();
  table = document.getElementById("myTable");
  tr = table.getElementsByTagName("tr");

  // Loop through all table rows, and hide those who don't match the search query
  for (i = 0; i < tr.length; i++) {
    td = tr[i].getElementsByTagName("td")[0];
    if (td) {
      txtValue = td.textContent || td.innerText;
      if (txtValue.toUpperCase().indexOf(filter) > -1) {
        tr[i].style.display = "";
      } else {
        tr[i].style.display = "none";

This is still a moving target, but I am assuming that this is legitimate at this stage, even if <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html">the CDC</a> is demurring a bit. I don't think that it's worth <i>not</i> getting the vaccine given this reality, but it is a thing.</td>

This remains one of the bigger gaps in my mind--how effective are the vaccines at preventing these outcomes? But the recent <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690v1">UK Biobank study</a> is a bombshell, and provides a parsimonious explanation for the "loss of taste and smell" presentation of covid we've seen. Some questions:
     <ol><li>Does this imply we're going to have a future epidemic of dementia in the elderly?<li>How protective are the vaccines against this? Does an asymptomatic/mild "breakthrough" infection mean that the brain is still at risk?</ol>
      To me this is the key covid gap right now. If vaccines protect against cognitive decay in most cases, then we are almost home free. If not, this is going to be a very big long-term problem for societies.</td>
